# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for rebuilding the FlyLive backend from scratch using Laravel 12. FlyLive is a scalable, interactive social platform enabling real-time audio communication, gifting, and community engagement. The new backend will serve as the primary API and business logic layer, supporting real-time communication with Mediasoup and Socket.IO servers, comprehensive user management, room management, coin economy, agency system, and administrative functions. The system is designed to scale to 100,000+ concurrent users with up to 15 active speakers and 1,000+ listeners per room.
