# FlyLive Backend Rebuild - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- **Complete Platform Rebuild**: Transform the current basic Laravel backend into a comprehensive real-time social audio platform backend
- **Scalability Achievement**: Support 60,000+ concurrent users with high-performance architecture
- **Feature Completeness**: Implement all missing features from the complete FlyLive vision (agency system, real-time integration, advanced social features)
- **Architecture Modernization**: Rebuild with Laravel 12 best practices, modular architecture, and proper separation of concerns
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieve sub-200ms API response times with Octane/Swoole optimization
- **Developer Experience**: Create maintainable, testable, and well-documented codebase

### Background Context
FlyLive is a real-time social audio platform similar to Bigo Live, enabling users to create audio rooms, interact through virtual gifts, participate in agencies, and engage in complex social interactions. The current Laravel backend has basic functionality but lacks critical features and architectural patterns needed for the complete platform vision.

**Current State**: Basic user management, simple room operations, coin system, and frame management
**Target State**: Complete social audio platform with agency system, real-time integration, advanced monetization, and enterprise-grade architecture
